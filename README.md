# SUNSAFE
A public repository for Flexion's EPA prototype response

##About SunSafe
Sunsafe uses the [EnviroFacts webservice](http://www3.epa.gov/enviro/) to deliver UV Index information by location, helping app users safely plan outdoor activities and prevent overexposure to the sun.

###Background

The UV Index provides a daily forecast of the expected risk of overexposure to the sun, predicting UV intensity levels ranging from  minimal risk of overexposure to very high risk, and taking into account cloud cover and local conditions that impact the amount of UV radiation a local would be exposed to.

Our persona, Susan, suffers photosensitivity as a result of a medical condition. As an active outdoorswoman and frequent traveler, she can easily spend 16-20 hours in the sun on any given weekend. Susan needs accurate UV Index information about the many locations she spends time outdoors in, to plan her *sun safe* gear for the day, whether that is simply sunscreen or a trifecta of sunscreen, long sleeves and sunhat to effectively shield her and limit painful and risky photosensitive reactions.
